#The number =3.1415926535897... is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter and shows basically everywhere in math and science. 
#It's like the most famous number in math. It's decimal expansion goes on forever but we can actually calculate it by summing up a bunch of fractions
#pi/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 ...
